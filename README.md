# Algorithms

Repository of basic algorithms that I've studied and written code for. 

Files:
- Primes.py (01-21-2017): Implementation of the Erato Sieve.
Includes a function to return a list enumerating all primes less than or equal to an integer N.
Possible Updates:
(1) Type Checking Inputs
(2) Memoization of known primes for faster computation and dynamically resizing the primes list
