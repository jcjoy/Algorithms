# Algorithms

Repository of basic algorithms that I've studied and written code for. 
Most were part of the course "Algorithms I" offered via Coursera by Stanford University. 
Some are utitilies that come in handy for other explorations and inquiries.

Files:
- Primes.py (01-21-2017): Implementation of the Erato Sieve.
Includes a function to return a list enumerating all primes less than or equal to an integer N.
Possible Updates:
(1) Type Checking Inputs
(2) Memoization of known primes for faster computation and dynamically resizing the primes list
